# galant.org

People often complement me on my personal website http://galant.org. It loads quickly, has responsive design, is mobile first and sports a trendy minimalist style. The first question I usually get is "Who's your webmaster(s) and is he/she/they available to be hired?" When I tell my admirers I made it myself, jaws drop. I'm often asked for the source code, but until now I've refused to release it. Inspired by Jimmy Walesm Brian Behlendorf, Tim O'Reilly, Eric Raymond, Linus Torvalds, Mitch Kapor, Paul Graham, Clay Shirky, Mahatma Gandhi and Paul Vixie, I've decided to open source my code. If you fork this and use it for your own website, all I ask is that you follow in my footsteps and open source it.
